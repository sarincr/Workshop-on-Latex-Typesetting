LaTeX  is a software system for document preparation. When writing, the writer uses plain text as opposed to the formatted text found in "What You See Is What You Get" word processors like Microsoft Word, LibreOffice Writer and Apple Pages. The writer uses markup tagging conventions to define the general structure of a document (such as article, book, and letter), to stylise text throughout a document (such as bold and italics), and to add citations and cross-references. A TeX distribution such as TeX Live or MiKTeX is used to produce an output file (such as PDF or DVI) suitable for printing or digital distribution. 

\section{Introduction}
You don't have to pay for using LaTeX, i.e., there are no license fees, etc. But you are, of course, invited to support the maintenance and development efforts through a donation to the TeX Users Group (choose LaTeX Project contribution) if you are satisfied with LaTeX.
\section{First Chapter}
You can also sponsor the work of LaTeX team members through the GitHub sponsor program at the moment for Frank, David and Joseph. Your contribution will be matched by GitHub in the first year and goes 100 \% to the developers. 
\subsection{Sub Chapter II}
The volunteer efforts that provide you with LaTeX need financial support, so thanks for any contribution you are willing to make.
\subsection{Sub Chapter II}
